## 🎯 What is this madness?

Welcome to **Underwaise** – the AI-powered underwriting revolution that emerged from the creative chaos of BaselHack 2025! We're automating insurance underwriting so efficiently, you'd think we had a crystal ball. (Spoiler: It's actually machine learning, but don't tell the VCs.)

Born during a caffeine-fueled weekend in Basel, this project transforms the soul-crushing manual process of insurance risk assessment into a sleek, AI-driven experience that would make even the most pessimistic actuaries crack a smile.

## 🚀 The Challenge

PAX threw down the gauntlet: **"Automate Underwriting – Create the Future of Insurance!"**

The problem? Insurance underwriting currently involves humans manually reviewing ~15 health questions, interpreting messy free-text responses, applying complex business rules, and making decisions that affect people's lives. It's slow, inconsistent, and about as scalable as a chocolate teapot.

The solution? **Us.** Armed with keyboards, questionable amounts of energy drinks, and an unhealthy obsession with transformer models.

## 🎪 The Dream Team

Meet the magnificent humans who sacrificed their weekend sleep schedules:

- **Arthur** 🍃 - Spring Boot Master
- **Regjep** ⚡ - Fast.js
- **Valentino** 🎩✨ - The Magician
- **Kathrin** 🏥🍬 - Insurance Queen & Sweet Supplier
- **Sebastian** 🤖🧠 - ML AI Expert
- **Morris** 🤖❤️ - The AI LL Export
- **Litty** 📋💼 - Insurance Tech Exprt
- **David** ☕️ - Old School Java Programmer

*Eight developers entered. One solution emerged. Zero regrets (maybe a few on Monday morning).*

## 🧠 What We Built

Underwaise is a next-generation underwriting engine that can:

### Core Superpowers
- 🤖 **Smart Input Processing** - Understands messy, incomplete, and free-text customer responses (yes, even "I sometimes eat cheese and my knee hurts")
- 📋 **Dynamic Business Rules** - Editable by non-technical users (because not everyone speaks Python, sadly)
- 🎯 **Intelligent Decision Making** - Approve, conditionally approve, modify offers, reject, or request clarification with full transparency
- 📈 **Self-Learning System** - Gets smarter over time through ML, NLP, and a sprinkle of reinforcement learning magic
- 🔍 **Explainable AI** - Every decision is transparent, comprehensible, and verifiable (no black box mysteries here!)

### The Secret Sauce
We combined cutting-edge AI with practical insurance know-how to create something that's actually usable in the real world. Revolutionary? Maybe. Fun to build? Absolutely.

## 🏆 BaselHack 2025

This project was created during **BaselHack** – *the* hackathon for Basel, Northwestern Switzerland, and the bordering regions of Alsace and Südbaden. It's where young and young-at-heart developers, tech enthusiasts, designers, and general troublemakers gather for a weekend of tinkering, developing, and consuming unreasonable amounts of free food and drinks.

**Challenge Details:**
- **Theme:** Automate Underwriting – Create the Future of Insurance
- **Sponsor:** PAX
- **Prize Money:** CHF 1,500.00
- **Date:** 17.10.2025
- **Hours of Sleep:** Not enough
- **Pizza Slices Consumed:** Too many to count

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*Details coming soon – we're still recovering from the hackathon.*

## 🚦 Getting Started

*Documentation in progress – check back when we've had more coffee.*

## 🤝 Contributing

Found a bug? Have an idea? Want to make insurance underwriting even more exciting (yes, it's possible)?

Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. We promise to review it faster than a traditional underwriter reviews an application.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- **PAX** for the awesome challenge and believing that insurance can be fun
- **BaselHack organizers** for the venue, food, drinks, and generally enabling our hackathon addiction
- **Our families** for understanding why we disappeared for a weekend
- **Caffeine** for obvious reasons

## 💬 Final Words

We came, we coded, we conquered (mostly). This project represents what happens when you give a group of passionate developers a real-world problem, some deadline pressure, and unlimited access to snacks.

Insurance underwriting will never be the same again. You're welcome, world.
